/nextmininote [on|off]    OR    /nmn [on|off]     OR     /mnmn [on|off]
Shows the next note created (using any method) as a MiniNote and also puts it on the WorldMap.  If invoked with no parameters, it will toggle the current state.

Like the previous command, but doesn't put the note on the WorldMap.

/mntloc tbX,tbY
Sets a "Thottbot location" on the map. Use it with no arguments to toggle it off.
